<body>People hide their conscious to the contributions of their damage done behind the stock market, grossly negligent to what actions are being done to scalp the resources with from both the land unsustainably and labour off peoples backs, typically sourcing the worst of it from outside their own country so the people they answer to don't have to see it.

There's a poem/letter that stuck with me by William Blake, The Chimney Sweeper, it's about how people would go to church feeling absolved of their sins as while their child dies in the snow cold and alone. Their guilt absolved because the big man said it was ok, passed on through their speakers.

I see the same thing with how people want to ignore the actions taken on their behalf so they can blindly see their money grow. Their local land undamaged, people treated kinder while the injustice is passed on to another nation.

And the uncomfortable truth for everyone is that it's not just those with the privilege of already having wealth that grows within the system that would see loss from a change in how corporate decisions are made, we'd all have to be happy with having less, as people are placated by having their nice things being made affordable to them, the true cost of what it takes to make stuff is hidden from the consumer

But I somewhat hope that with the divide being ever shifted to move more to those at the top, people will move to be more open to making those adjustments to consume less needed to make things fairer.

Where we can begin is a fairer society where people don't have to worry about affording to eat or a place to rest their head.

We produce more than enough food to go around, even sustainably for a much larger population so if we reduce our dependence on meat. But that's another tyrade. We need to provide a proper support system so that people aren't compelled to sell their morals to survive, you can't blame the average person for their actions when they're doing what they need to survive.

Universal basic income would allow people to exist, this doesn't need to be via monetary form, food, health, home and warmth, what we call utilities should be a given. 

With a basis of support people can pursue their true passions, and then the jobs deemed essential but unwanted would mandate a fair pay to cleaners, farm workers, service staff, health workers and more my mind is unable to name. The jobs the "wealth creators'' deem unvaluable and undeserving of fairer pay, the things they say people should seek to move out of such a position. 

The man hours and effort lost to luxuries, super yachts are the epitome of this, the pollution spewn for a handful of individuals. The whims of few who scalp the labour of us all. On a smaller scale, the need to own and run a car, we saw what happened when needs mandated mid pandemic, the roads were clear, people assisted each other locally, dropping food off to those sheltering or fallen ill where needed. We saw the same coming from WW2 in Britain, the NHS was birthed out of post war good will and need to provide for each other. Why does it require strife to grow as a society as a whole, everyone needs to be more conscionable to the needs of each without catastrophe leading the change. We need to stop forgetting.  

Population growth happens out of necessity for more hands to provide, but who's necessity alters. As those above who hunger for more drive the need. Whether that be the drive of a budding society we see within indigenous populations which we see level out as everything needed to survive levels off. Then the insidious side of desire from scalpers to control a population and provide even more to them. We see religion twisted for this action, why is contraception purported to be evil by historical Catholicism, we see the same still going on with pro-life rhetoric pulling back the rights of women in the USA. Although that also is being used to shift the political argument from how we can progress to a moral one that divides the agenda as finely as possible so the discussion does not shift and even moderate progressive ideals are shifted to be perceived as radical. A large uneducated population is ideal to bend to your whim.


Beginning Actions: 
Regulation at the accountancy level, these are the people who know the dirt, where the money is going, the companies being paid that are unscrupulous in their actions for their growth.

We have some level of it but this is typically only used to track unpaid taxes and financial misconduct with outgoings going to shell companies under the guise of trade. We're making strides here, but we need to shift the agenda to include outsourced immoral ethics.

These saints are the boogeymen known as Auditors.

This along with embedding regulation that extends worker/human rights enforced in our country to the supply chains of business'.
